# DATS 6103 Data Mining Project ‚Äì 2025 Spring

## Goal
The goal of this project is to use Python to obtain, pre-process, and clean a dataset of your choice, and present a study that includes EDA, model building, and analysis. The project emphasizes technical analysis, critical thinking, teamwork, communication, and visualization skills.  

This project includes an in-person presentation (15-20 minutes per team). Feedback will be provided by the instructor and classmates. Based on all the work and comments, each team will submit a final paper of 10-15 pages (less than 5000 words) explaining their analysis and results.  

The dataset must have at least **4000 observations** and **8 or more relevant features**.  

---

## Steps for Completion (100 points total, 25% of course grade)

1. **Topic proposal (4 points)** ‚Äì Team grade  
2. **Presentation slides (12 points)** ‚Äì Team or individual grade (your choice)  
3. **Presentation (24 points)** ‚Äì In-person, individually graded  
4. **Git usage (12 points)** ‚Äì Individually graded from GitHub repo history  
5. **Codes (24 points)** ‚Äì Team grade, evaluated for technical skills  
6. **Final Write Up (24 points)** ‚Äì Team grade, evaluated for interpretation and writing skills  

*Note: The instructor may adjust grades if there is strong evidence of unequal contributions.*

2. **Presentation Slides:** April 23 (email to instructor by a team representative).  
3. **Team Presentation:** April 23 for Section 10, April 24 for Section 11.  
4. **Discussion Forum Feedback:** Due by April 27.  
5. **Python Code & Final Report:** April 30 for Section 10, May 1 for Section 11.

## Part 1: Topic Proposal
Your topic proposal (one per team) should include:  
1. The research topic your team chose.  
2. The SMART question(s) of your research.  
3. The source of your dataset(s).  
4. The link to your team‚Äôs GitHub repo.  
5. The modeling methods you propose to use (this can be modified later).  

---

## Part 2: Presentation Slides
- Use PowerPoint, Google Slides, or another appropriate tool.  
- Keep slides concise with bullet points and visuals (charts, graphics, animations).  
- Avoid cramming text; focus on readability and accessibility.  
- Ensure proper contrast and use sans-serif fonts.  
- Decide if your slides will be graded as a team or individually (default: team graded).  

---

## Part 3: Presentation
- Each team prepares a 15-minute presentation delivered on the presentation day.  
- All members should participate, with roughly equal speaking time.  
- Make a strong impression with clear, organized content.  
- Presentation scores are awarded individually.  

---

## Part 4: Git Usage
- Use Git for source-control management.  
- Commit often, fetch/pull regularly to ensure smooth teamwork.  
- Add ‚Äúning-rui‚Äù as a collaborator to your private repo.  
- Avoid last-minute pushes; update your work regularly.  
- This part is graded individually based on your GitHub activity.  

---

## Part 5: Codes
- Submit a separate Python file (`.py`) with your working codes.  
- Clearly indicate all packages being imported.  
- Include the dataset or provide a link to it (online or on GitHub).  

---

## Part 6: Final Write Up
- Format: Word document or PDF, fewer than 5000 words.  
- Structure your report logically to present your research and findings.  
- Include the following sections, if applicable:  
  - Overview of your project (topic, prior research, dataset description).  
  - SMART questions and how you developed them.  
  - Models or machine learning algorithms used.  
  - Interpretation of results.  
  - Predictions and conclusions.  
  - References (APA style).
