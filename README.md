# DATS 6103 Data Mining Project ‚Äì 2025 Spring

## Goal
The goal of this project is to use Python to obtain, pre-process, and clean a dataset of your choice, and present a study that includes EDA, model building, and analysis. The project emphasizes technical analysis, critical thinking, teamwork, communication, and visualization skills.  

This project includes an in-person presentation (15-20 minutes per team). Feedback will be provided by the instructor and classmates. Based on all the work and comments, each team will submit a final paper of 10-15 pages (less than 5000 words) explaining their analysis and results.  

The dataset must have at least **4000 observations** and **8 or more relevant features**.

## Steps for Completion (100 points total, 25% of course grade)

1. **Topic proposal (4 points)** ‚Äì Team grade  
2. **Presentation slides (12 points)** ‚Äì Team or individual grade (your choice)  
3. **Presentation (24 points)** ‚Äì In-person, individually graded  
4. **Git usage (12 points)** ‚Äì Individually graded from GitHub repo history  
5. **Codes (24 points)** ‚Äì Team grade, evaluated for technical skills  
6. **Final Write Up (24 points)** ‚Äì Team grade, evaluated for interpretation and writing skills  

*Note: The instructor may adjust grades if there is strong evidence of unequal contributions.*
